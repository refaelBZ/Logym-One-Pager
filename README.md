-   **Styling:** **SCSS (Sass)** - For writing advanced, organized, and maintainable CSS.
-   **Custom Design:** The entire UI and all components were designed and built **from scratch**, without relying on external UI libraries like Bootstrap or Material-UI.

## Goal & Strategy

The main goal of this landing page is simple: **to get new users to start using the app.** Every part of the page was designed with this strategy in mind:

1.  **Show the Problem:** Start by relating to the user's frustration with complicated fitness apps.
2.  **Introduce the Solution:** Immediately present Logym.fit as a simple, fast, and easy alternative.
3.  **Build Value:** Clearly list the core benefitsâ€”like speed, ease of use, and privacyâ€”not just features.
4.  **Drive to Action:** Use a clear and repeated Call to Action (CTA) that invites users to try the app immediately, with zero friction.

## Design & User Experience (UI/UX)

The design was built from scratch to be unique, clean, and easy to understand. The key principles are:

-   **One-Pager Simplicity:** All the important information is on a single, scrolling page. This guides the user through a story without needing to navigate.
-   **Strong "Above the Fold":** The main headline and the primary CTA are the first things users see, grabbing their attention and showing the app's value right away.
-   **Minimalist & Focused:** The design is clean with a careful color scheme, plenty of white space, and a clear section layout. This helps the user focus on the message without distractions.
-   **Clear & Concise Text:** The language used is short, direct, and benefit-focused to be as clear as possible.
